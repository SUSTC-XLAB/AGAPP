# Crop health assistant
## Project profiles
* Diagnosis and identification of diseases for crops
## Background Information
* In order to ensure the effective and reasonable application of pesticides to control crop diseases, agricultural producers must accurately obtain the growth information of crops, so that agricultural producers can quickly and accurately diagnose the causes and degree of diseases of affected crops according to the disease information obtained. With the continuous enhancement of computer processing capacity and the rapid development of image processing and recognition technology, digital image processing and recognition technology is more and more widely used in agriculture, and will become an important technical force to realize agricultural informatization and automation. Agricultural information collection has a huge workload, the real-time and accuracy of information is a common concern in the field of agricultural production and scientific research. How to quickly and timely determine crop diseases accurately has been an important part of computer technology research in the field of agriculture.[http://cdmd.cnki.com.cn/Article/CDMD-10157-2009194421.htm](url)
