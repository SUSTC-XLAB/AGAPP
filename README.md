# 农作物健康助手 
  Crop health assistant
## 项目简介 
## Project Profiles
* 识别和诊断农作物病变
* Diagnosis and Identification of Diseases for Crops
## 背景信息 
## Background Information
* 为保证有效合理地施用农药防治农作物病害,农业生产者必须准确的获取作物的生长信息,这样,农业生产者可根据获得的病害信息快速、准确的诊断受害作物的病因以及受害程度,因病治宜。随着计算机处理能力的不断增强,以及图像处理与识别技术的快速发展,数字图像处理与识别技术在农业中的应用越来越广泛,并将成为实现农业信息化与自动化的重要技术力量。农业信息采集工作量巨大,信息的实时性和准确性是农业生产和科学研究领域普遍关注的问题,如何及时快速地进行农作物病害的准确判断一直是计算机技术面向农业领域研究工作的一项重要内容。[http://cdmd.cnki.com.cn/Article/CDMD-10157-2009194421.htm](url)
* In order to ensure the effective and reasonable application of pesticides to control crop diseases, agricultural producers must accurately obtain the growth information of crops, so that agricultural producers can quickly and accurately diagnose the causes and degree of diseases of affected crops according to the disease information obtained. With the continuous enhancement of computer processing capacity and the rapid development of image processing and recognition technology, digital image processing and recognition technology is more and more widely used in agriculture, and will become an important technical force to realize agricultural informatization and automation. Agricultural information collection has a huge workload, the real-time and accuracy of information is a common concern in the field of agricultural production and scientific research. How to quickly and timely determine crop diseases accurately has been an important part of computer technology research in the field of agriculture.[http://cdmd.cnki.com.cn/Article/CDMD-10157-2009194421.htm](url)
